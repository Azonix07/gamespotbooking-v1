## 🚨 CRITICAL: Action Items for YOU

Your website is **technically SEO-ready**, but you need to complete these steps to activate full search visibility:

### ⚠️ **STEP 1: Update Website Placeholders (15 minutes)**

Open: `/next-frontend/src/app/page.tsx`

Replace these placeholders:
```typescript
Line 35: telephone: '+91-XXXXXXXXXX'  → Add your real phone number
Line 43: streetAddress: 'Kodungallur' → Add exact street address
Line 49: latitude: 10.2269            → Verify/update GPS coordinates
Line 50: longitude: 76.1950           → Verify/update GPS coordinates
Line 61: sameAs: []                   → Add Instagram/Facebook URLs
```

**After updating:**
```bash
cd /Users/abhijithca/Documents/GitHub/gamespotweb/next-frontend
npm run build
git add -A
git commit -m "update: Add real business contact information"
git push origin main
```
