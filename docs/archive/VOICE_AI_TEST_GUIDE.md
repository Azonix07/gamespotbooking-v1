2. **"HELLO!"** - Loud greeting (strong vibration)
3. **"What are your prices?"** - Long question (sustained vibration)
4. **"Games"** - Short word (quick pulse)
5. **"Thank you very much!"** - Enthusiastic (dramatic reaction)

- Solid dark container

### **New Version (NOW):**
- ✨ Blurred glassmorphism background
- ✨ DRAMATIC 3D vibrations (very visible)
- ✨ Natural human-like voice
- ✨ Auto-start microphone
- ✨ Transparent container

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Issue: Microphone not starting**
- **Solution**: Check browser permissions
- Chrome: Settings → Privacy → Microphone
- Allow microphone access for localhost

### **Issue: Background not blurred**
- **Check browser**: Chrome/Safari work best
- Firefox has limited blur support
- Try refreshing page (Cmd+Shift+R)

### **Issue: Sphere not vibrating much**
- **Solution**: Speak louder
- Check microphone volume in system settings
- Try getting closer to microphone

### **Issue: Voice sounds robotic**
- **Check console**: See which voice is being used
- Chrome: Should use "Google" voices
- Safari: Should use "Samantha" or "Karen"
- May need to download system voices

### **Issue: Not auto-starting**
- **Wait 1 second**: 800ms delay is intentional
- Check status indicator for "Listening..."
- Try refreshing page
